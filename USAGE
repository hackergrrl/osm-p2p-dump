USAGE:

  osm-p2p-dump [OPTIONS]... [DIR]

  Where DIR is the osm-p2p-db directory containing at least the 'log'
  directory. If 'index' and/or 'kdb' DBs aren't present, they will be generated
  on-demand.

  -h, --help                display this help and exit
  -j, --json                output as newline-delimited json
  -y, --yaml                output as newline-delimited yaml (default)
  -l, --log                 operate on a hyperlog directly; generates temporary
                            indexes automatically
  -t, --top                 only print top-level (head) documents (not their
                            older revisions)
